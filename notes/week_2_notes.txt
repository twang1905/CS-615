Lecture 02
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've watched the Week 2 YouTube playlist and skimmed the File Systems and Storage Models
reading material.

I've finished HW1 and created another folder in this repo documentating my work. I've also
sent an email to the professor to my GitHub repo.

Question: How are the number of inodes calculated on a given file system? Is it a fixed
number or is it calculated based on the size of the file system?

    - SCSI
    - SATA
    - SSD
 - Storage Protocols
    - ATA over Ethernet (AoE)
    - Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)
    - *oE
    - Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
 - Disk Device Confiuration
    - Single Disk
    - JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks)
    - RAID

I enjoyed the class talking about their experiences with the first homework. The class came
both similar and different conclusions about the homework. For an example, everyone agreed
that it took an enourmous amount of time for the inodes to be used. Also, some people had
different solutions on how to use all the inodes. I hope homework 2 has the same amount of
varibility in solutions.
