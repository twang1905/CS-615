Lecture 07
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've watched the Week 7 Youtube playlist about the Domain Name System, and I've checked out
some of the blog posts linked in the Week 7 block.

I've completed the Week 7 checkpoint.

After class:
-------------
 - How do you remember each system's IP address?
 - Domain name space consists of a tree of domain names
  - Starts with "." at the root
  - Tree is sub-divided into zones consisting of domains and sub-domains
  - Domains under the root are Top Level Domains (TLDs)
  - Can be divided further
  - Authority over a zone may be delegated
  - A Fully Qualified Domain Name ends in "."
 - General purpose domains
  - .com: commercial
  - .edu: education
  - .gov: government
  - .mil: military
  - .org any other organization
  - .arpa: "temporary" use by ARPA
  - country codes
 - Layer 9
  - Registries may function as a Domain Name registrar or may delegate Domain Name registration
  - If you control one node, you control the branches underneath
 - A simple lookup
  - DNS server is non-authoritative
  - Resolves by asking other servers
   - Authoritative name server provides answers
   - Resolver relays answers it determined by asking authoritative name servers
   - Example asks the root where a domain is
   - Slowly go down the domain tree to figure it out through DNS
