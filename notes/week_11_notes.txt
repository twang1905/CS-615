Lecture 11
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've watched the Week 11 Youtube playlist about configuration management, 
and I've checked out the blog post about it in the Week 11 block. 

I've completed the Week 11 checkpoint and the 6th homework.

Unfortunately, the AWS meetup has been cancelled, so I'm still looking for
a replacement event to attend.

After class:
-------------
At the beginning of class, we discussed the issues and technical details for
the 6th homework. One universal observation was that the distros used for the
homework was extremely finicky, and most of them had to be hard coded in some
way. One issue that compounded on this problem was that it was hard to debug
the script because the script was running on a remote machine, and all we had
to go on was the output of the script. There's obviously no debugging functions
on a text editor, so bugs had to be solved by going through the code line-by-line.
People also had issues with logging occurring locally, but not remotely. We
discussed in the class lecture about this point further, and how the logging 
worked between the two machines.
