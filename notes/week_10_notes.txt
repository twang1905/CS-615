Lecture 10
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've watched the Week 10 Youtube playlist about backups, and I've checked out
some of the blog posts linked in the Week 10 block. I noticed that some of
the material goes of syslog, which is an important component of homework 6.
I'll probably be going back to this material while I'm doing the assignment.

I've completed the Week 10 checkpoint.

I've been talking to another classmate about completing the group meetup, and
we've been looking at meetup.com to see if there are any events that we could
attend. Hopefully we'll go to event either this week or next week. I also need
to find an article to talk about as well.

After class:
-------------
This class had an interesting turn of events, as the xz backdoor exploit was
discovered on the Saturday before class. I was able to find a blog post about
the exploit and read up on it before class. Essentially, someone had slowly
been committing to XZ Utils, and eventually became a trusted contributor. They
slowly added backdoor code which would allow them to bypass auth for SSH logins
by manipulating the sshd config file. The vulnerability was discovered by a
Microsoft engineer who was miraculously able to find the exploit by looking into
some anomalies in his benchmarking. He was debugging why his SSH logins were 
running slowly, and narrowed it down to sshd and a couple of odd valgrind
errors. Also, this was right before Debian and Red Hat were going to push their
next releases, so they were able to catch the exploit before it was released.
In class, we talked about the exploit further in depth, and how it was able to
manipulated the systems surrounding sshd and OpenSSH to accomplish creating the
backdoor.
