Lecture 06
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've watched the Week 6 YouTube playlist and read the Basic Network Troubleshooting blog post.

There was no Week 6 Checkpoint, so all of my efforts this week have been focused on Homework 3.

There's a bunch of meetup suggestions on the Slack, and I'm planning on going to a meetup over
spring break.

After class:
-------------
Our class discussed the issues and findings we had with homework 3. One of the observations that
we made was that depsite the geolocations for IPv6 being less developed than those for IPv4, the
routing for IPv6 was actually more efficient than that for IPv4. Speaking of geolocation, we
discussed the fact that since geolocation is based on voluntary reporting, it's not always accurate.

There was also Elena's presentation about the claims and debunks about the security of Linus versus
the security of Windows. The main takeaway was that the security of an operating system is not
inherently tied to the number of vulnerabilities that are found in it. Instead, the main issue lies
in user error. There's also the pitfall that the more popular an operating system is, the more
vulnerabilities will be found in it. Jokingly, Elena concluded that the best way to make Linux more
secure is to dissaude people from using it.
