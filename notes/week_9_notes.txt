Lecture 09
==========

Before class:
-------------
There wasn't a YouTube playlist for this week, so I did some of the exercises and
read the blogs for week 9. I'm assuming that the scripting knowledge from this
chapter will be used in homework 6.

I've completed the Week 9 checkpoint and homework 5.

After class:
-------------
The class discussion was brief, as the homework wasn't too involved at all.
The main thing we noticed was that SMTP didn't require any form of verification,
so it was possible to send emails from any address. This is a pretty big security
flaw, but we discussed using protocols like POP3 and IMAP to somewhat mitigate
this issue. STARTTLS came up to provide confidentiality and integrity,
but it lacked authentication. The issue of other IP addresses being blocklisted
by SpamHaus seemed to be an issue exclusive to me, which was pretty strange.
