Lecture 12
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've watched the Week 12 Youtube playlist about system security, and I've 
checked out the blog posts about security in the week 12 block. 

I've completed the Week 12 checkpoint.

I've found a replacement for the cancelled AWS in-person meetup with a 
hybrid event. I've registered for the event and will be attending it
on the 18th of April.

After class:
-------------
The 6th homework was graded, so we could discuss all the issues that our
scripts had running. One of the biggest issues that came up in grading was
that #/bin/bash didn't work on FreeBSD and NetBSD. Even though it ran on
my system, most people (including myself) assumed that bash would be on
all systems. It didn't cross my mind to change the script off of bash
since I've never had to change it before in the past. I'll make sure to
test other alternatives like #/bin/sh in the future. Another problem
that grading encountered was the installation of rsyslog. The scripts
had to be fully automated, so pressing 'y' to install rsyslog was
obviously goes against this. The solution was easy, just add -y to the
apt-get install command. I implemented this change early on when I was
testing, mostly because I got tired of pressing 'y' every time.
The last issue that came up was the use of the how some scripts kept
impending on /etc/syslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.conf. People used '>>'
to append to the files, but this would cause the script to append the
same line repeatedly. Some people used '>', but this overwrote
the file. The common solution was to create your own .conf file exclusively
for the script. This way, the script could append to the file without
interfering with the system's configuration.
