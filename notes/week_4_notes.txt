Lecture 04
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've watched the Week 4 YouTube playlist and read the "Software Installation and Package Management"
and "Of Users and Groups" chapters.

I've finished the Week 04 Checkpoint.

There was still no homework this week, so I've spent some time doing the exercises listed in the chapter
4 section.

After class:
------------
Important take-aways:
 - Software is software, even when its firmware or middleware
 - Software can be grouped into:
    - "Low-level" / firmware
    - "OS"
    - "Add-on software"
        - The difference between add-on software and OS software is not always clear
 - Firmware
    - Bits of software executing early on
    - Less flexbility, less "soft"
 - Kernel
    - Different types of OS kernels: microkernels and monolithic kernels
    - Needs a more useful environment to do its purpose (the OS)
    - The "motor" of the car
 - Operating System
    - Bits and pieces not running in kernel space, but necessary for the system to run
    - OS needs to be tightly integrated with kernel
 - System Software
    - Additional functionality, but is involved in how to operate the system and how to interact with it
    - Core components of the OS and bits that influence their behavior
 - OS Installation Process
    - Power the system
	- No bootloader, need alternate media (boot device)
	- Identify root device and optional additional disks
	- Create partition table
	- Create filesystems
	- Install MBR, bootlocks, etc.
	- Fetch OS software (HTTPS, iSCSI)
	- Install / Copy / Extract OS
	- Optional add-on application software
	- Perform basic system configuration
    - Reboot
 - Package Management
    - Easy and scalable installation of software
	- Automatic resolution of software dependencies
	- Package and file inventory
	- Package and file integrity checks 
    - Vulnerability checks

After going through the week 4 material in class, half the class was the traditional lecture focusing on the
multiuser funamentals. I'm currently studying for a cybersecurity cert, so I was already familiar with some
terms listed on the slides, like Zero Trust. However, this lecture went deeper on the implications on the 
implementation of these concepts on the user level. I've learned a lot about how users will still try and mess
with the multi-user system, and how to mitigate these risks.
