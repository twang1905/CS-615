Lecture 05
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've watched the Week 5 YouTube playlist and read the blog post titled "WHOIS: Fragile, unparseable, 
obsolete... and universally relied upon." The WHOIS dilemma reminds me of the same problem with
COBOL, where the language is still in use, but its old age makes it difficult to maintain and
understand. It even has the same problems as WHOIS, where the language is very readable for humans,
but the lack of structure has made it difficult to maintain and understand.

I've finished the Week 05 Checkpoint.

Homework #2 is due this Wednesday and has taken over the spot of the old Homework #2 (now Homework #3).
I've finished it and sent a professor a .tar file of the specifications listed on the course website.
I've detailed more of the process in the Homework #2 README file, but the huge RPM packaging guide made
this homework more complicated than I expected to.

After class:

Important take-aways:
 - IPv4
    - 32-bit address
    - 4 groups of 8 bits
    - Running out of addresses
 - IPv6
    - 128-bit address
    - 8 groups of 4 hex digits
    - Zeroes are compressed, only once
    - 2^128 addresses
    - Every user is assigned a /64
    - Header is larger, but simpler
 - netmask
    - Allows for subnetting
    - Splits a network into smaller networks
    - Splits IPv4 address into network and host
    - Entire address space is /32
    - Example: /24 is
        - Host bits: 8
        - Network bits: 24
        - 2^8 = 256
        - 256 - 2 = 254
        - 254 hosts

We spent a portion of the class talking about Homework 2. Unsurprisingly, the class had a lot of trouble
completing the homework. The class discussed talking points on what was difficult about the homework, and
we narrowed the points down to rpmbuild, file permissions, source package vs binary package, macros, and
the 615 user creation. Out of these points, I struggled with macros the most personally, since they were
causing a lot of issues with the build directory not being found. People also highlighted their troubles
working with the .spec file, as creating a RPM package like this was a new experience for all of us.
