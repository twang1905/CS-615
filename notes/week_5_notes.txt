Lecture 05
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've watched the Week 5 YouTube playlist and read the blog post titled "WHOIS: Fragile, unparseable, 
obsolete... and universally relied upon." The WHOIS dilemma reminds me of the same problem with
COBOL, where the language is still in use, but it's old age makes it difficult to maintain and
understand. It even has the same problems as WHOIS, where the language is very readable for humans,
but the lack of structure has made it difficult to maintain and understand.

I've finished the Week 05 Checkpoint.

Homework #2 is due this Wednesday, and has taken over the spot of the old Homework #2 (now Homework #3).
I've finished it, and sent a professor a .tar file of the specifications listed on the course website.
I've detailed more of the process in the Homework #2 README file, but the huge RPM packaging guide made
this homework more complicated than I expected to.

After class:
