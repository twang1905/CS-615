Lecture 14
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've checked out the blog posts about ethics and social responsibility
in the week 13 block. The CtF is likely to be sometime this week, so
I've been looking for a team to form.

I've completed review checkpoint.

After class:
------------
We had three presentations this week, and all of them were about various aspects of
cybersecurity. The topics were about AirTags being used maliciously, exploring 
vulnerabilities through social engineering, and understanding the dynamics of 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. I found the AirTags presentation to be
the most interesting, as I never knew how they worked. They broadcast a public key
over BlueTooth that can be picked up by other devices, and then the location data is
sent to the owner of the AirTag through Apple's servers. I already knew about issues
concerning AirTags being used for stalking, but I didn't know the solutions in
development were extremely intricate. Essentially, a combination of tracking the
movement, how much the public identifier is used, and how often the AirTag is
detected by other devices can be used to determine if the AirTag is being used
maliciously.

For the class discussion, we went over ethics and social responsibility. It's
extremely hard to defuse ethical dilemmas, as there are many factors to consider
like legal != ethical, and having to sometimes choose an unethical option to
keep your job. There are many codes of ethics created by various organizations
like the ACM, IEEE, and ISACA to help guide us in the right direction.
However, it's ultimately up to the individual to make the right decision and to
act in the public interest. 

We also went over the CtF, and I found out that the groups were pre-assigned. 
The project should last 10 days, and we've already started working on level 0.
