Lecture 08
==========

Before class:
-------------
I've watched the Week 8 Youtube playlist about Email, and I've checked out
some of the blog posts linked in the Week 8 block.

I've completed the Week 8 checkpoint.

After class:
-------------
 - Email utilizes a simple text based protocol, SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol)
 - Mail System
    - Mail User Agent (MUA)
       - example: Outlook, mutt
       - the program that you use to read your email and to compose your emails
	   - command line, mail programs, or browsers
	- Mail is sent to Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
	   - example: postfix, sendmail, qmail
	   - There is an outgoing and ingoing MTA
	- MTA hands off to Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
	   - example: procmail
	- Mail server is not directly accessible to user, an access agent is used
       - Allows remote access via a separate protocol, like POP or IMAP

At the beginning of class, we discussed the challenges and findings of homework 4. 
It was probably the most straightforward homework assignment so far, so there weren't
many questions about troubleshooting the DNS server and client. The class mostly
discussed our findings in the server tcpdump, like the order that the requests came in
due to DNSSEC and seeing what packets came first in the server's tcpdump.
